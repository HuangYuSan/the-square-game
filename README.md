# The Square Game
A small game I made just for fun. Inspired by [Aqua Energizer](http://www.miniclip.com/games/aqua-energizer/de/#t-c-f-C) and [Crypt Raider](http://www.miniclip.com/xplore/game-crypt-raider/de/#t-c-f-C) on Miniclip (both of which I've never played myself). They follow a different game principle, focussing on speed and killing enemies instead of solving a puzzle, but the rules of gameplay are the same. As I have no idea of programming at all, I didn't do most of it myself. Instead, I used a lot of code from [Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/)'s awesome [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game, which in turn is based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/). However, the levels! I did the levels myself! Yeiy :D
